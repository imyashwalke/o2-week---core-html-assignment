    <h3>Q1. Write a simple program in HTML that displays the heading “I am happy to Learn Web Development” on
        the web broser.</h3>

    <h1>I am happy to learn web development.</h1>
    <br>

    <h3>Q2. Write a simple program in HTML, the webpage must contain the
        heading “Comments” and below the heading add some information about
        comments. The webpage must be rendered on the web browser as
        below image.</h3>

        <h2>Comments</h2>

        <p>Html has a special syntax for including the comments in the 
        code, which are not visible to users when rendered in browser.
        comments in html are used to include notes or explanation in the code,
        which can be helpful for understanding complex code logic. 
        You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when 
        you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful 
        if you have a lot of code. hese tags tell browsers to ignore anything between them. 
        For example, say you're building a website with a team of developers. 
        Types of HTML Comments: There are three types of comments in HTML 
        which are: Single-line comment. Multi-lines comment. Using comment tag.
        Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML
        lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Q3. Write a short note on tags, elements, and attributes along ith relevant examples.</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Tags</li>
            <p>tags are used to define elements in an html document. tags are surrounded
                by angle brackets (<>) and are used to mark up content on a web page.
                html tags can be either opening tag or closing tag, and they define the
                beigining and the end of element.
                <h5 style="display: inline;">opening tag = </h5> 
                this consist of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing brackets.
                this opening tag marks where the element beigns or start to take effect.
                <h5 style="display: inline;">closing tag = </h5>
                this is the same as the opening tag, except that it include a forward slash before
                the element name. this marks where the element ends.
                <h5>Common tags = </h5>
                some example : <ul>
                    <li>Heading h1 to h6</li>
                    <li>paragraph (p)</li>
                    <li>Div (div)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <li>Element</li>
            <p>An HTML element is a component of an HTML document that tells a web browser 
               how to structure and interpret a part of the HTML document. HTML elements 
               can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and content.
               Html tag along with content it is called a element. element is the 
               most basic component of a html document, which can represent text, paragraph, 
               list, or any other content in a web page.
            </p>

            <li>Attributes</li>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Html attributes are used to provide some additional information
                    or properties to html elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    attributes are added to an elements opening tag using the syntax. <br>
                    attribute_Name = "attribute_value".
                <li>attributes are used to modify the behavior apperance, or other 
                    properties of an element.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Comman tag attributes</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>tag</li>
                <li>class</li>
                <li>style</li>

   some of advantages are :
   <ul>
    <li>increase productivity</li>
    <li>developers can save time and reduce the number of keystrokes needed to write code </li>
    <li>easier to understand and maintain</li>
    <li>simplified coding</li>
   </ul>

   <h5>Q6. Using emmet create another webpage similar to questions 1 and 2.</h5>

   <h2>I am to learn web development</h2>

   <h2>Comments</h2>

        <p>Html has a special syntax for including the comments in the 
        code, which are not visible to users when rendered in browser.
        comments in html are used to include notes or explanation in the code,
        which can be helpful for understanding complex code logic. 
        You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when 
        you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful 
        if you have a lot of code. hese tags tell browsers to ignore anything between them. 
        For example, say you're building a website with a team of developers. 
        Types of HTML Comments: There are three types of comments in HTML 
        which are: Single-line comment. Multi-lines comment. Using comment tag.

        lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors. 
        </p>

    
    <h5>Q7. Explain in brief about the nesting operators in emmet.</h5>

    <p>Nesting operators help to place elements with respect to other elements.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>child >

        <li>siblings +
            <ul>
                <li>Utilize the (+) operator to position elements close to each other, at the same level. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Multiplication *
            <ul>
